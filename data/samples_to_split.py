“Gatz is my name.”

“—Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West.”

He shook his head.

“Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in
the East. Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr.—?”

“We were close friends.”

“He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man,
but he had a lot of brain power here.”

He touched his head impressively, and I nodded.

“If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man. A man like James J.
Hill. He’d of helped build up the country.”

“That’s true,” I said, uncomfortably.

He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the
bed, and lay down stiffly—was instantly asleep.

Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at
either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the
Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running
together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and
dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as
she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.

When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.

“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in
our very next issue.”

Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she
stood up.

“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the
ceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”

“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy,
“over at Westchester.”

“Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.”

I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous
expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the
sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard
some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I
had forgotten long ago.

“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”

“If you’ll get up.”

“I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”

“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy. “In fact I think I’ll arrange a
marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you
together. You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push
you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”

“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs. “I haven’t heard a
word.”

“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment. “They oughtn’t to let
her run around the country this way.”

“Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.

“Her family.”

“Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’s
going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots
of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be
very good for her.”

Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.

“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.

“From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our
beautiful white—”

“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?”
demanded Tom suddenly.

“Did I?” She looked at me. “I can’t seem to remember, but I think we
talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept
up on us and first thing you know—”

“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.

“Did the "Snow" go down? Who knows?” she asked, sobbing and crying, and
quite broken down by hearing the fact put into words.

“I’m sorry we said a word,” said Kate, crying with Mrs. Dobson; and,
dropping down upon a footstool, she laid her head in Mrs. Dobson’s lap.

“You will please forgive us, won’t you?” spoke up the boy in the bed.

“Forgive you! Yes, indeed. I’m glad you thought enough about my
poor—about Captain Dobson to talk of him at all, and to-day, too! Why, I
always go down the harbor to-day; it is just thirty-seven years ago
to-day since we were married and the ship went on its voyage.”

“And you will go this afternoon, won’t you?” questioned Kate.

“I mustn’t,” she said simply.

“Why not?”

“Why, I’ve got a little boy of my own to look after to-day, don’t you
see?” she said, suddenly smiling, with an uplifted face.

Harry Cornwall ran out from the tent to watch the flight of Frank
Hallock, who ran, frightened by the tiger, and as the boy disappeared
from sight over the hilltop, Harry determined to try and find time
enough that very evening to run up to the big house and tell all he knew
about the necklace that somebody had tucked into the pocket of the
waistcoat that fell to Jack Flibbit after the great fire. Harry could
not persuade himself that two little girls in the land had put two
necklaces, with the same mark, into pockets to go “Out West.” Harry’s
name was called in a loud tone, and he ran to obey the call at about the
same moment that Frank Hallock reached the cornfield and picked up his
hoe.

Frank counted the hills and the rows, and scarcely looked up until the
sound of the one o’clock train, on the New Haven Railroad, passing
through the town, told to him how short the hour had been.

Then Neptune came home. Frank knew that Kate was on the carriage-road
that ran past the field, but he would not look up, not even when he
heard her cheery call to him; so Neptune and Kate went on their way, and
presently the welcome sound of the dinner-horn was heard.

Frank did not throw down his hoe, but fell to work harder than ever. In
five minutes’ time the horn was sounded again, and on looking up, Frank
beheld Kate standing on the veranda—she was waving her hat to attract
his attention. He was inclined to make a martyr of himself just then, so
he waved his straw hat in return, and immediately resolved to “hoe away
like a major.”

In fifteen minutes more Kate was making her way for the second time that
day through Frank’s cornfield. As she drew near, she called out, “Frank!
Frank! why in the world don’t you come to dinner? There is a gentleman
at table who came to see papa on business, and I ran away after the
soup—I couldn’t eat my dinner one bit, without you.”

“You’ll _have_ to, I reckon,” returned Frank; “a poor fellow, like me,
who has to hoe corn all day, can’t stop to eat.”

“O, Frank Hallock! _for shame!_” cried Kate, putting down her indignant
foot without being able to make noise enough about it to disturb an
earthworm.

“It’s _true_,” responded Frank, pitching into the next hill with all his
might.

“It is _not_ true,” cried Kate; “and if just running off to _look_ at
the circus pass by makes you say such things, I am glad you can’t go to
see it.”\

ARCH_WIKI_1 = """\
This document is an annotated index of popular articles and important information for improving and adding functionalities to the installed Arch system. Readers are assumed to have read and followed the Installation guide to obtain a basic Arch Linux installation. Having read and understood the concepts explained in #System administration and #Package management is required for following the other sections of this page and the other articles in the wiki.
System administration

This section deals with administrative tasks and system management. See Core utilities and Category:System administration for more.
Users and groups

A new installation leaves you with only the superuser account, better known as "root". Logging in as root for prolonged periods of time, possibly even exposing it via SSH on a server, is insecure. Instead, you should create and use unprivileged user account(s) for most tasks, only using the root account for system administration. See Users and groups#User management for details.

Users and groups are a mechanism for access control; administrators may fine-tune group membership and ownership to grant or deny users and services access to system resources. Read the Users and groups article for details and potential security risks.
Security

Read Security for recommendations and best practices on hardening the system.

For a list of applications to allow running commands or starting an interactive shell as another user (e.g. root), see List of applications/Security#Privilege elevation.
Service management

Arch Linux uses systemd as the init process, which is a system and service manager for Linux. For maintaining your Arch Linux installation, it is a good idea to learn the basics about it.

Interaction with systemd is done through the systemctl command. See systemd#Basic systemctl usage for more information.

A logging system is also provided, with the command journalctl. See journal for more information.
System maintenance

Arch is a rolling release system and has rapid package turnover, so users have to take some time to do system maintenance.
Package management

This section contains helpful information related to package management. See FAQ#Package management and Category:Package management for more.
Note: It is imperative to keep up to date with changes in Arch Linux that require manual intervention before upgrading your system. Subscribe to the arch-announce mailing list or the recent news RSS feed. Alternatively, check the front page Arch news every time before you update.
pacman

pacman is the Arch Linux package manager: it is highly encouraged to become familiar with it before reading any other articles.

To enable downloading packages in parallel, see pacman#Enabling parallel downloads.

For long term handling of cached packages, see pacman#Cleaning the package cache.

See pacman/Tips and tricks for suggestions on how to improve your interaction with pacman and package management in general.
Repositories

See the Official repositories article for details about the purpose of each officially maintained repository.

If you plan on using 32-bit applications, you will want to enable the multilib repository.

The Unofficial user repositories article lists several other unsupported repositories.

You may consider installing the pkgstats service.
Mirrors

Visit the Mirrors article for steps on taking full advantage of using the fastest and most up to date mirrors of the official repositories. As explained in the article, a particularly good advice is to routinely check the Mirror Status page for a list of mirrors that have been recently synced. This can be automated with Reflector.
Arch Build System

Ports is a system initially used by BSD distributions consisting of build scripts that reside in a directory tree on the local system. Simply put, each port contains a script within a directory intuitively named after the installable third-party application.

The Arch build system offers the same functionality by providing build scripts called PKGBUILDs, which are populated with information for a given piece of software: integrity hashes, project URL, version, license and build instructions. These PKGBUILDs are parsed by makepkg, the actual program that generates packages that are cleanly manageable by pacman.

Every package in the repositories along with those present in the AUR are subject to recompilation with makepkg.
Arch User Repository

While the Arch Build System allows the ability of building software available in the official repositories, the Arch User Repository (AUR) is the equivalent for user submitted packages. It is an unsupported repository of build scripts accessible through the web interface or through the Aurweb RPC interface.
Booting

This section contains information pertaining to the boot process. An overview of the Arch boot process can be found at Arch boot process. See Category:Boot process for more.

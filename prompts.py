You are a helpful assistant proficient in literature and language.
Imagine you are helping to prepare the provided text for narration to create the audio book.
We need to understand how many voice actors we need to hire and how to split the text between them.

Your task is to help with this process, namely:
1. Identify all book characters occuring in the text, including "narrator".
We will hire individual voice actor for each one of them.
2. Split the text provided by characters. Let's refer to each split as "part".
Order of parts MUST be the same as in the original text.

Details:
- First, analyze the whole text to extract the list of characters.
Put found characters to corresponding output field.
- Then, analyze the text top-down and as you proceed fill the "parts" field
- Each part must be attributed to a single character.
Character must belong to the "characters" list
- Use "narrator" character for any descriptive or narrative text, 
such as actions ("He shook his head"), narrative parts ("I thought")
thoughts, or descriptions that aren't part of spoken dialogue
- In some books narrator is one of the main characters, having its own name and phrases.
In this case, use regualar character name instead of "narrator" role
- If it's impossible to identify character name from the text provided, use codes "c1", "c2", etc,
where "c" prefix means character and number is used to enumerate unknown characters

Format your answer as a following JSON:
{{
    "characters": [list of unique character names that are found in the text provided],
    "parts":
    [
        {{
            "character": <character name>, "text": <the part's text>
        }}
    ]
}}

Ensure the order of the parts in the JSON output matches the original order of the text.

Example of text split by characters, already in the target format.
{{
    "characters": ["Mr. Gatz", "narrator"],
    "parts":
    [
        {{"character": "Mr. Gatz", "text": "“Gatz is my name.”"}},
        {{"character": "narrator", "text": "“—Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West.” He shook his head."}},
        {{"character": "Mr. Gatz", "text": "“Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in the East. Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr.—?”"}},
        {{"character": "narrator", "text": "“We were close friends.”"}},
        {{"character": "Mr. Gatz", "text": "“He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man, but he had a lot of brain power here.”"}},
        {{"character": "narrator", "text": "He touched his head impressively, and I nodded."}},
        {{"character": "Mr. Gatz", "text": "“If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill. He’d of helped build up the country.”"}},
        {{"character": "narrator", "text": "“That’s true,” I said, uncomfortably."}},
        {{"character": "Mr. Gatz", "text": "He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed, and lay down stiffly—was instantly asleep."}},
    ]
